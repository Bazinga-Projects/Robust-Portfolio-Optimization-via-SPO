# Robust Portfolio Optimization via SPO

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a machine learning system—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation—applied to **Robust Portfolio Optimization via Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO)**. The goal is to build a reliable prediction-driven optimization system that can later be accessed through an intuitive web-based interface.

At present, the project focuses on the **backend and model logic** implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The **frontend is in the building phase** and will be implemented using **Streamlit**, allowing users to interact with the model easily. **Deployment is planned in a future update**.

## 🔮 Frontend & Deployment Status

* 🏗️ **Frontend:** Currently under development
* 🎨 **Framework:** Streamlit
* 🌐 **Deployment:** Planned for a future release

Once completed, the Streamlit app will allow users to input portfolio parameters and receive **real-time optimized portfolio recommendations** based on the trained SPO model.
